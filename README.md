# Fundamentals-Assessment 2019
Submitted by Paula Daly

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook Fundamentals-Assessment.ipynb, in this jupyter notebook I have:
 - Described the tips dataset with the use of descriptive statistics and plots
 - Analysed whether there is a relationship between the total bill and the tip amount
 - Analysed the relationship between the variables within the dataset

 To run the Jupyter notebook file you will need to have Python installed through Anaconda Distribution to ensure you have all the relevant packages required to run the jupyter notebook and CMDer will also be required to be installed.
 
 In CMDer you can clone the repository https://github.com/pauladaly/Fundamentals-Assessment.git.  Once the repository is cloned to your system to open the Jupyter notebook on the command line enter: Jupyter notebook.
